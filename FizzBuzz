44.	Have the function FizzBuzz(num) take the num parameter being passed and return all the numbers from 1 to num separated by spaces but replace every number that is divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz", replace every number that is divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", and every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz".


def FizzBuzz(num):
  result = ""
  for i in range(1, num+1):
      if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
        result += "FizzBuzz "
      elif i%3 == 0:
        result += "Fizz "
      elif i%5 == 0:
        result += "Buzz "
      else:
        result += str(i) + " "
  return result.strip()
print(FizzBuzz(input()))
