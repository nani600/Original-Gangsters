The `preorderTraversal(strArr)` function, written in JavaScript, aims to traverse a binary tree represented by an array of strings `strArr`. This binary tree follows a heap-like format where each node's children are located at indices 2n+1 and 2n+2, with NULL nodes represented by the symbol '#'. The function's objective is to perform a pre-order traversal of the tree, which visits each node in the order of root, left subtree, right subtree, and returns the elements separated by a space. For example, if the input `strArr` is `["5", "2", "6", "1", "9", "#", "8", "#", "#", "#", "#", "4", "#"]`, it represents a binary tree where the pre-order traversal would yield "5 2 1 9 6 8 4".

    if i >= len(binary_tree) or binary_tree[i] == "#":
      if len(stack) > 0:
        queue.append(stack[-1])
        stack.pop(-1)
      continue
    output += (binary_tree[i] + " ")
    i *= 2
    queue.append(i + 1)
    stack.append(i + 2)
  output = output.strip()
