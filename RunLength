22.	Have the function RunLength(str) take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the Run-length encoding algorithm. This algorithm works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with a single character of the repeating sequence. For example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p. The string will not contain any numbers, punctuation, or symbols.


def RunLength(strParam):
    encoded_string = ""
    count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(strParam)):
        if strParam[i] == strParam[i - 1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            encoded_string += str(count) + strParam[i - 1]
            count = 1
    encoded_string += str(count) + strParam[-1] 
    return encoded_string
print(RunLength(input()))
