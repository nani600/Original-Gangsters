Using the Python language, have the function CountingMinutes(str) take the str parameter being passed which will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) separated by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times. The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am then the output should be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320.

def CountingMinutes(string):
  times = string.split('-')
  final = []
  for time in times:
    hours, minutes = time.split(':')
    hour = int(hours)
    if hour == 12:
      hour -= 12
    if 'pm' in minutes:
      hour += 12
    minute = int(minutes.replace('am','').replace('pm',''))
    absolute_minutes = hour * 60 + minute
    final.append(absolute_minutes)
  result = final[1] - final[0]
  if result < 0:
    result += 1440
  return result
print(CountingMinutes(input()))
