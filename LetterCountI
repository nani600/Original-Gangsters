19.	Using the Python language, have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.


import collections
def LetterCountI(strParam):
  maxCount = 0
  maxWord = ''
  words = strParam.split(' ')
  for word in words:
    most = max(dict(collections.Counter(word)).values())
    if most > maxCount and most > 1:
      maxCount = most
      maxWord = word


  if maxCount:
    return maxWord
  else:
    return '-1'
print(LetterCountI(input()))
