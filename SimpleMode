Using the Python language, have the function SimpleMode(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the number that appears most frequently (the mode). For example: if arr contains [10, 4, 5, 2, 4] the output should be 4. If there is more than one mode return the one that appeared in the array first (ie. [5, 10, 10, 6, 5] should return 5 because it appeared first). If there is no mode return -1. The array will not be empty.

from collections import Counter
def SimpleMode(array):
  count = Counter(array)
  mode = count.most_common(1)[0][0]
  if len(set(count.elements())) == len(array):
    return '-1'
  return mode
print(SimpleMode(input()))
