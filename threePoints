The `threePoints(strArr)` function, implemented in JavaScript, is designed to analyze an array of three string elements `strArr`, each representing a point in a two-dimensional plane in the format "(x,y)". The function's goal is to determine the position of the third point relative to the line formed by the first two points. It achieves this by creating a line segment between the first two points and then assessing whether the third point lies to the right, left, or neither side of this line. For instance, if `strArr` is `["(1,1)", "(3,3)", "(2,0)"]`, indicating points (1,1), (3,3), and (2,0) respectively, the function would return "right" because the third point lies to the right of the line formed by the first two points.


def ThreePoints(strArr):
  arr = []
  for c in strArr:
    arr.append(eval(c))
  m = (arr[0][0] - arr[1][0]) * (arr[0][1] - arr[2][1]) - (arr[0][1] - arr[1][1]) * (arr[0][0] - arr[2][0])
  if m < 0:
    return 'right'
  elif m > 0:
    return 'left'
  else:
    return 'neither'
print(ThreePoints(input()))
