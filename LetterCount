29.	Have the function LetterCount(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.?

from collections import Counter 
def LetterCount(string):
  list_words = string.lower().split(' ')
  max_count = 1
  final_word = '-1'
  for word in list_words:
    count = Counter(word).most_common(1)[0][1]
    if count > max_count:
      max_count = count
      final_word = word
  return final_word
print(LetterCount(input()))
